# subset-sum
1) Run subset-sum.py
2) The list of random numbers will appear on screen.
3) Next you have to provide a Target sum (positive integer)
4) Wait for the ouput.

important: Change L = random.sample(range(1,n), 'how many numbers you want in list')

eg. L = random.sample(range(1,1000), 100)     #This will give list of 100 random numbers in range 1-1000.
